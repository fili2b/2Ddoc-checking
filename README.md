# 2Ddoc-checking 

Created by Alexis STOELTZLEN and Thérèse FILI for a cryptographic project.

## Purpose 

This repository contains a Java code that allows you to verify a 2D-doc.

## Contents of the repository

There are 2 folders :
- images folder : contains 2D-doc images that have been verified by the code
- src : contains the source code

## Usage

Open the project and go into the Decrypt 2D-doc class. Then, at line 33, you can indicate the path to a 2D-doc image you want to 
decrypt and verify. Please, note that this code doesn't support the 01 version of 2D-doc.
